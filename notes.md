### Categories

#### Functionalities
- You can create categories
- You can upload pictures for categories
- You can edit categories
- You can delete categories

#### Missing
- Weird bug doesn't allow you to go directly to /dashboard/categories (categories show no children)
- Maybe: Modal prompt before category deletion: (Do you want to keep these images?)
- For people using multiple images in their categories: An option to select first preview image. (if you use something like a carousel)
- Deletion works, but there are no checks. Nothing like: if (!res.ok) {error modal opens}
