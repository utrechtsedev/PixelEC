Let me create a comprehensive roadmap for the PixelEC e-commerce project. The user is a starter in software development building an open-source Shopify-like store to enhance their portfolio and potentially use with freelance clients. I'll need to organize this in 

Markdown format that they can copy to Obsidian.

Based on the information provided, here are the key aspects of the project:

    Tech Stack:
        Frontend: SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI
        Backend: Express
    Core Focus:
        Backend functionality
        Dashboard with analytics
        Product management
        Client management
        Category management
        Financial management
    Limited Frontend Focus:
        3 styles of pages (home/category/products/product)
        Ability to enable/disable components
        Basic customization only
    Key Features Needed:
        Image uploading (direct to server or S3)
        Analytics (user needs suggestions)
        Client management features (user needs suggestions)

I'll structure a roadmap that provides:

    A clear vision statement
    Project phases with milestones
    Detailed feature breakdowns
    Technical implementation steps
    Analytics suggestions
    Client management functionality suggestions

This should help the user stay motivated and have a clear path forward for development. I'll focus on making it practical and achievable for someone with 3 years of development experience who hasn't secured a full developer role yet.

Let me create this roadmap in a clean Markdown format that will work well in Obsidian:
